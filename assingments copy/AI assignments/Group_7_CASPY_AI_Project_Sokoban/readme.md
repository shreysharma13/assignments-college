This program aleready has 8 levels, 6 of which are the ones which are to be graded and the other two being the bonus levels.
To run the solver, the user needs to run all the cells from the .ipynb file and input an integer between 1-8.

If the user needs to use any other level then that file needs to be named as "level{}.txt" where any integer can be put. This file needs to be saved in the "sokubanlevels" folder.
